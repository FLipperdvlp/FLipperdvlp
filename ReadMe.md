# 👋 About Me

### Hey there!  
I’m a high school student originally from **Ukraine 🇺🇦**, but now living in **Poland 🇵🇱**.  
Here I split my time between **studying programming** and enjoying **active outdoor activities**.

## 💻 Passion for Programming
- I spend most of my free time learning **C#, .NET, ASP.NET Core, and DevOps practices**.  
- I love exploring how software works under the hood and experimenting with new technologies.  
- My projects often include **web applications, cloud integration with Azure ☁️, and MVC architecture**.  
- I'm fascinated by **CI/CD pipelines** and dream of automating every boring task with smart solutions.

## 🎯 Dreams & Goals
- In the near future, I’m planning to study **Computer Science / Computer Engineering** at  
  **Wrocław University of Science and Technology 🇵🇱**.  
- My career path is aimed at becoming a **Software Engineer** or **DevOps Engineer**.  
- I imagine myself working and living in **Austria 🇦🇹** — one of my big goals.  
- But my ultimate dream is to live in **Portugal 🇵🇹** 🌴☀️,  
  because I love the idea of combining coding with the **warm sun, ocean waves, and sandy beaches**.

## 🌟 Fun Fact
I believe programming is like surfing 🌊:  
sometimes the wave (a bug 🐞) knocks you down,  
but once you learn how to ride it, the feeling of solving the problem is amazing! 🚀
