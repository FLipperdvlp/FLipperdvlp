# 👋 About Me

Hi there! I'm a high school student from Ukraine 🇺🇦 who is passionate about programming and technology.
I’m currently in Opole, Poland 🇵🇱, and soon I’ll be moving to Wrocław to start my studies at Wrocław University of Science and Technology in the field of Computer Science / Computer Engineering.
I love building things, solving problems, and constantly learning new technologies.
